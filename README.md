This is a very simple UI Designer for HTML, Custom Elements, and Polymer.

## Disclaimers
I have only tested this in Chrome desktop. 

## Developing

  * Install Bower dependencies
```
        $ npm install -g bower
        $ bower install
```

  * Run the app in a local server
```
        $ python3 -m http.server --bind localhost 8000
```

  * Navigate Chrome to [localhost:8000]() to see the app.
